Study the grid before the interview. Reducing each story to just a couple of keywords may make the grid easier to study and recall. 

Ensure you have one to three projects that you can talk about in detail. You should be able to discuss the technical components in depth. These should be projects where you played a central role.

### What are your weakness?
Give a real weakness! A good answer conveys a real, legit weakness but emphasizes how you work to overcome it.

### What questions should you ask the interviewer?
Three general types of questions.
1. Genuine Questions
Those questions you actually want to know the answers to.

2. Insightful Questions
Questions demonstrate your knowledge or understanding of technology.

3. Passion Questions
Designed to demonstrate your passion for technology. They how you're interested in learning and will be a strong contributor to the company.


## Know Your Technical Projects

Focus on two or three technical projects  that you should deeply master. Select projects that ideally fit the following criteria:
- The project had challenging components (beyond just "learning a lot").
- You played a central role (ideally on the challenging components).
- You can talk at technical depth.

For those projects, and all your projects, be able to talk about the challenges, mistakes, technical decision, choices of technologies (and tradeoffs of these), and the things you would do differently.

You can also think about follow-up questions, like how you would scale the application.

## Responding to Behavioral Questions

Behavioral questions allow your interviewer to get to know you and your prior experience better. Remember the following advice when responding to questions. 

### Be specific, Not Arrogant 
Specificity means just the facts and letting the interviewer derive an interpretation. 

### Limit Details
Stay light on details and just state the key points. Try to translate it or at least explain the impact. Always offer the interviewer the opportunity to drill in further with "I can go in more detail if you'd like."

### Focus on Yourself, Not Your Team
Pay attention to your answers. Listen for how much you say "we" v.s. "I". Assume that every question is about your role, and speak to that. 

### Give Structure Answers
Two basic response models:

1. __Nugget First:__ Succinctly describes what your response (topic) will be about. 
2. __S.A.R. (Situation, Action, Result)__: 
    - Situation:  
    - Action: (Calm down and Find the roots causes)
    - Result:


|                  | Nugget      |    Situation  |  Action(s) | Results | What It Says |
| :---             |    :----:   |       :---:   |  :---:     | :---:   |    ---:      |
| Story 1          |             |               |  1. ....   |         |              |
|                  |             |               |  2. ....   |         |              |
