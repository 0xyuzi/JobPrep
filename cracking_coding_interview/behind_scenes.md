# Behind the Scenes 

## The Microsoft Interview

You'll have a short interview with a recruiter who will give you a sample question. Your recruiter is usually there to prep you, not to grill you on technical questions. If get asked on basic technical questions, it may be because your recruiter wants ease you into the interview so that you're less nervous when the "real" interview starts. Be nice to your recruiter.

During the day, you'll do four or five interviews, often with two different teams. Unlike many companies, where your meet your interviewers in a conference room, you'll meet with your MS interviewers in their office. This is a great time to look around and get a feel for the team culture.

Depending on the team, interviewers may or may not share their feedback on you with the rest of the interview loop.

When completing the interviews with a team, you might speak with hiring manager. If so, you're good to pass the interviews with a particular team. It's now to the hiring manager's decision.

You might get a decision that day, or it might be a week. After one week of no word from HR, send a friendly email asking for a status update.


### Definitely Prepare

"Why do you want to work for Microsoft?"

Show the passion about their technology.

### What's Unique

Only reach the hiring manager if you've done well, so if you do, that's a great sign!  \

Additionally, Microsoft tends to give teams more individual control, and the product set is diverse. 

## The Amazon Interview

Amazon's recruiting process typically begins with a phone screen in which a candidate interviews with a specific team. sometimes, two or more phone interviews.

The engineer who interviews you will usually ask you to write simple code via a shared document editor. They will also often ask a broad set of questions to explore what areas of technology you're familiar with.

Next, you fly to Seattle (or whichever office you're interviewing for) for 4 - 5 interviews with one or two teams that have selected you based on your resume and phone interviews. You will have to code on a whiteboard, and some interviewers will stress other skills. Interviewers are each assign as specific area to probe and may seem very different from each other. They cannot see the other feedback until they have submitted their own, and they are discouraged from discussing it until the hiring meeting.

The "bar raiser" interviewer is charged with keeping the interview bar high. They attend special training and will interview candidates outside their group in order to balance out the group itself. If one interview seems significantly harder and different, that's most likely the bar raiser. The person has both significant experience with interviews and veto power in the hiring decision. Remember, through: just because you seem to be struggling more in this interview doesn't mean you're actually doing worse. Your performance is judged relative to other candidates; it's not evaluated on a simple "percent correct" basis.

Once your interviewers have entered their feedback, they will meet to discuss it. They will be the people making the hiring decision.

While Amazon's recruiters are usually excellent at following up with candidates, occasionally there are delays. If you haven't heard from Amazon within a week, we recommend a friendly email.

### Definitely Prepare
Amazon cares about a lot about scale. Make sure you prepare for scalability questions. You don't need a background in distributed systems to answer these questions. see our recommendations in the System Design and Scalability chapter.

In addition, Amazon tends to ask a lot of questions about object-oriented design. Check out the OOD chapter for sample questions and suggestions.

### What's Unique
The Bar Raiser is brought in from a different team to keep the bar high. You need to impress both this person and the hiring manager.

Amazon tends to experiment more with its hiring process than other companies do. The process described here is the typical experience, but due to Amazon's experimentation, it's not necessarily universal.


## The Google Interview

A Google engineer performs the first phone screen, so expect tough technical question. These questions may involve coding, sometimes via a shared document. Candidates are typically held to the same standard and are asked similar question on phone screens as in on-site interviews.

On your on-site interview, you'll interview with four to six people, one of whom will be a lunch interviewer, so you can be assured that you enter each interview which blank slate. You lunch interviewer doesn't submit feedback, so this is a great opportunity to ask honest questions.

InInterviewer are typically not given specific focuses, and there is no "structure" or "system" as to what you're asked when. Each interviewer can conduct the interview however she would like.

Written feedback is submitted to a hiring committee (HC) of engineer and managers to make a hire or no hire recommendation. feedback is typically broken down into four categories (Analytical Ability, Coding, Experience, and Communication) and you are given an overall score from 1.0 to 4.0. The HC usually does not include any of your interviewers. If it does, it was purely by random chance. 

To extent an offer, the HC wants to see at least one interviewer who is an "enthusiastic endorser". In other words, a packet with scores of 3.6, 3.1, 3.1 and 2.6 is better than all 3.1s.

You do not necessarily need to excel in every interview, and you phone screen performance is usually not a strong factor in the final decision.

If HC recommends an offer, your packet will go to a compensation committee and then to the executive management committee. Returning a decision can take several weeks because there so many stages and committees.

### Definitely Prepare
Google cares about how to design a scalable system. So, make sure you prepare for questions from SYstem Design and Scalability.

Google puts a strong factor on analytical (algorithm) skills, regardless of experience. You should be very well prepared for these questions, even if you think your prior experience should count for more.

### What's Different 
Your interviewers do not make hiring decision. Rather, they enter feedback which is passed to a hiring committee. THe hiring committee recommends a decision which can be -though rarely is -rejected by Google executives.
