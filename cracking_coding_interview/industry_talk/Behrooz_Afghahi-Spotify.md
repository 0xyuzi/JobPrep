## Data Science Skills

### Math and stats
- Frequentist  and Bayesian approaches
    - Used in experimentation
    - Causal Inference
    - Statistical models (regression, ect.)
- Linear Algebra
    - Heavily used in ML fields
    - Foundation of many approaches like vector spaces
- Multivariate Calculus: computational optimizations
- Graph Theory: search, knowledge discovery
- Set Theory
- Many many more specialized subjects

## Computer Science Skills

## Product and Project Management (less talked about)
- Product Lifecycle
    - employing and iterating on model in production

- Project Management

- Task automation

## Business Skills & Domain Expertise
- Understanding the context/problem
    - When to user what tool/model/process

- Translating the context into quantifiable entities
    - Metric setting
    - Feature engineering
    - Stat representation of proc
- Working in uncertain environments
    - Lack of data
    - Lack of process
    - Vague requirements or vision

## Design adn Communication Skills
- Visualization
    - [informationisbeautiful.net](informationisbeautiful.net)

- Comnucation complex concepts to non-technical users
    - Business/internal users
    - End users using your ML product

- UX/UI
    - Mainly affecting your end users

## Introduction to Company
- Small size company
    - Tech as Product
        - Type1: User ML/AI and related research as a product
        - Uses analytics/stats to improve product 

    - Non-tech focused 
        - Small market as startup don't see DS as a must for early success

- Mid-size companies

- Established companies

## Breaking down the roles (ordered by demand from high to low)

### Product Data Scientist 
- Experimentation and Audience Understanding 
- Works in collaboration with a product/engineering manager and user researchers (qualitative research)
- Knows basic programming, probably uses Python scientific stack
- Uses SQL a lot
- Is sometimes expected to work with engineers to setup data pipelines and help with experiment setup
- Presents information through analysis and dashboards

### Business Analyst
- Mainly works with internal colleagues
    - Helps them use data to make decisions
    - Interfaces btw technical and non-technical parts of the company
- Specialized in one part of the business
    - Pricing and finance data scientists at Spotify
- Use viz tools and metric setting to track health of the company from various aspects
- Regular communicates technical subjects with non-technical colleagues

### Business Data Scientist
- Complex business problems using ML
        - LTV at Spotify
- Models are mostly not end-user facing
    - Forecasting, various optimizations and automation of process
    - Customer support NLP models at Spotify
- Solve business problems through math modeling 
- Less focus on algorithmic efficiency ans use cases are not user facing and latency is not as critical 


### Analytics Engineer
- Btw data engineering and data science 
    - Knows engineering concepts well
    - Understands what goes into a successful analysis or modeling projects
- Has a good understanding of distributed systems
- Can create dashboards to visualize data in basic ways 
- Partners with data scientists and engineers to bridge the gap

### ML Practitioner
- Understand of stats and math, specially topics related to modeling, e.g. linear algebra and calculus (But mainly uses existing models and tools)
- Trains various types of models and manage parts of the entirely of
    - Feature engineering and data flow
    - Deployment, serving and monitoring
    - Iteration and performance analysis 
- Good understanding of distributed systems and performance
- Works with other data scientists and engineers to understand implementation needs


### ML/AI Researcher

## Where should You Be?
- Take advantage of the diversity
    - Do what you're interested in 
        - Visualizer and storyteller vs modeler and mathematician
        - Product side vs business side
        - Research vs implementation
    - Tak advantage of your existing background to get a headstart
    - Don't need to know everything in the field to be successful
    - Choose your trajectory not your destination

## Evolving Job Functions

## Challenges
- Ways of working varies depending on your colleagues
    - Product vs. business vs. engineering vs. research

- Standardization of process and beat practices
    - Similarly varies depending on the technical level of your company and the stage it is in
- Over-reliance on data
    - The false perception that anything can be solved with data, even if the information gain from the data is very low

- Perception of a data scientist
    - Anywhere from the data fetcher to the person who can fix the company problems with AI
    - Similarly, anywhere from instrumental to unnecessary

## Q&A
- Looking for the first-time internship: Learn stats and programming, learn from Kaggle, basic ML models, scientific way of thinking problems

- Many cross-functions in startup companies 

- Scientific minds: Masterclass, TV scientific person
