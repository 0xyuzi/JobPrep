4-5 different types
- Modelling case study
    - describe how you would build the model
    - common frameworks
    - whole fundamental ML 
- Recommendation engine/ search engine
    - build own from scratch 
- Build 
    - SVM, boosting tree
    - how to generate trees

- Modelling scenarios
    - 90% accuracy, deploy or not?
    - real life experience
